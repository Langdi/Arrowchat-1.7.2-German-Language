This Software License Agreement (this "Agreement") is between you (either an individual or an entity, referred to hereinafter as "you" or "your") and ArrowSuites LLC and its affiliates ("ArrowChat", "we", "our" or "us") for the ArrowChat 0.1+ software that accompanies this Agreement, as may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements, software updates or maintenance releases (the "Software") and any services that may be provided by ArrowChat under this Agreement ("Services"). Do not use the Software until you have carefully read the following Agreement.

By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or using the Software (or authorizing any other person to do so) you are indicating that you are 18 years of age or older (any parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 may accept this Agreement on behalf of a user), are capable of entering into a binding legal agreement, have read and understand this Agreement and you accept its terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not install, copy, access, download or use the Software. Any breeches in the contract may lead to account closure.
1. Grant of License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ArrowChat grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to install, download and use a single instance of the Software on a single website server ("License") through a single installation. Each License may run one instance of the Software on one domain. Any modification of the Software intended to circumvent the foregoing is prohibited and will result in revocation of the License.

You may make a one-time, permanent transfer of your rights in the Software to a third party ("Subsequent Licensee"), provided the Software was purchased by you more than 90 days prior to the transfer, that you do not keep a copy of the Software for yourself, the Subsequent Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and the License, and the Subsequent Licensee agrees to assume your rights as a licensee of the Software. You must disclose the domain where you are using (or plan to use) the License, which may be disclosed in the ArrowChat registered members area. You may set up one additional temporary test chat for the purpose of testing code, template and database modifications. Such a test chat must be password protected, and not made available to the general public at any time.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Software" includes (and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to) any updates, updated or replacement features enhancements, bug fixes or modified versions (collectively, "Update"). "Update" means a release of the Software which adds minor functionality enhancements to the current version. This class of release is identified by the change of the version number to the right of the decimal point, i.e. 1.1 to 1.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you have no License or right to use any such Update unless, at the time of acquiring such Update, you already hold a valid License to the original Software and have paid any applicable fee for the Update.
2. Restrictions

You may not give copies to another person, or duplicate the Software by any other means, including electronic transmission. If ArrowChat files are found on another machine other than your own, regardless of how the files were obtained, this will be considered a breech in contract. You may make one copy of the Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. You may not rent, sublicense, assign, lease, loan, resell for profit, distribute, publish or network the Software or related materials or create derivative works based upon the Software or any part thereof.

You may not use the Software to engage in or allow others to engage in any illegal activity. You may not use the Software to engage in any activity that will violate the rights of third parties, including, without limitation, through the use, public display, public performance, reproduction, distribution, or modification of communications or materials that infringe copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights, privacy rights, other proprietary rights, or rights against defamation of third parties.

The License is effective until terminated. You may terminate the License at any time by uninstalling the Software and destroying all copies of the Software in any media. This Agreement may be terminated by ArrowChat immediately and without notice if you fail to comply with any term or condition of the License or this Agreement. Upon such termination, you must immediately cease using the Software, and destroy all complete and partial copies of the Software.

ClickBank customers are offered a 60 day refund as required by ClickBank policies. No other customers are offered refunds at this time due to the product being available for download instantly after purchase. No refunds are offered on professional installation or support services. Upon a refund within 60 days (for ClickBank customers), the License must be terminated according to the above paragraph. ArrowChat reserves the right to deny a refund for the following reasons including, but not limited to sharing the script, not uninstalling the software from the server, engaging in criminal activity on arrowchat.com, or any other reason ArrowChat sees fit.

Customers who re-purchase ArrowChat after already receiving a refund are not permitted to receive a second refund. In addition, their license expiration time and support expiration time will be deducted minus the time already used.

ArrowChat reserves the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time (including but not limited to Internet-based Solutions, pricing, technical support options, and other product-related policies), and to change, discontinue or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Software, or any Internet-based Solutions provided to you or made available to you through use of the Software. Such changes will be effective upon notification by any means reasonable to give you actual or constructive notice including by posting such terms on the Arrowchat.com website, or another website designated by ArrowChat.
